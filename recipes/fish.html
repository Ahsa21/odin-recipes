    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into strips.</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 Â½ pounds cod fillets</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sliced potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with cold water.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a separate medium bowl. Add milk and egg; stir until batter is smooth. Let stand for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pot or electric skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
